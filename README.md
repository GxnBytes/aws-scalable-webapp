# Scalable Web Application on AWS with CI/CD  
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Completed-brightgreen)

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates deploying a **scalable web application** on **AWS** using containers, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and CI/CD pipelines.  
It highlights cloud engineering and DevOps practices such as automation, load balancing, monitoring, and auto scaling.  

---

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated  
- Deploying containerized apps with **ECS (Fargate)** or **EKS**  
- Infrastructure as Code with **Terraform / CloudFormation**  
- CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions + AWS CodePipeline**  
- Application Load Balancing + **Auto Scaling Groups**  
- Monitoring with **CloudWatch dashboards & alarms**  

---

## ☁️ AWS Services Used  
- **ECS (Fargate) / EKS** – Container orchestration  
- **ALB** – Application load balancing  
- **Auto Scaling Groups** – Scale based on demand  
- **CodePipeline + GitHub Actions** – CI/CD integration  
- **CloudFormation / Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code  
- **CloudWatch** – Monitoring & alarms  
- **ECR + S3** – Container image + artifact storage  

---

## 📌 Implementation Steps  
1. **Infrastructure Setup** – VPC, subnets, security groups with IaC  
2. **App Deployment** – Containerized app deployed to ECS/EKS with ALB  
3. **CI/CD Pipeline** – Automated build & deployment with GitHub Actions + CodePipeline  
4. **Monitoring & Scaling** – CloudWatch metrics, alarms, and Auto Scaling policies
