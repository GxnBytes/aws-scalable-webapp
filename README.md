# React App Deployment on AWS with Elastic Beanstalk & Terraform

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Development-yellow)

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a **React application** to **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, using **Terraform** for automation.

Elastic Beanstalk simplifies cloud deployment by handling **provisioning, scaling, and load balancing**, so you can focus on building your app not managing infrastructure manually.

All infrastructure is created using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, not through the AWS Console.
